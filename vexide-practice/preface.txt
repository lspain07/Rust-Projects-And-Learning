This folder is meant to serve as the storage place for all the programs I write specifically using the designations
from the Vexide rust library, which is used with Vex. The only reason I decided to separate this out is because
of how different Rust code written using Vexide can look. Also, Vexide requires me to run Rust nightly, and none
of the code in this folder will work without. Thanks.
