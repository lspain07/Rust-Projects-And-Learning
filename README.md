This repository documents the programs that I write during the course of my journey learning Rust.  
In order to learn Rust, I'll be using a combination of the official Rust book and youtube tutorials that I find to be the most helpful.  

In addition, this repository will include the work that I do with Vexide, as that library is the reason I am learning Rust.  
Vexide requires Rust nightly, and several installations detailed in the Vexide documentation at -> https://vexide.dev  
To switch to Rust nightly, enter the following command in your console:  
```rust
rustup default nightly
```
To switch back to Rust stable, enter the following command in your console:  
```rust
rustup default stable
```

Understand that when looking through this repository, anything outside of the Vexide labeled folders was not written with Rust nightly in mind.  
Despite that, everything detailed here (outside of Vexide) should remain up-to-date with the most current version of Rust as of September 23 2025.
